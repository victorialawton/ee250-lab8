Question 1: What are the denominations of the US coins from the green, blue and orange
distributions? Can you think why the coins from the same denomination might show variation in
weight although they are specified to be of the same weight? If your vending machine had a
weight sensor, how would you use the weight of a coin that was just inserted to find the
denomination?

Question 2. We can shine light on the coin and measure the reflected amount of light which
should be proportional (directly or in some non-linear way) to the size/area of the coin. Can you
guess which sensor on the Grove Pi Kit can be used for this purpose?

Question 3: Which of the following datasets are linearly separable? Justify your answer.

Question 4. Sometimes we need more than a simple hyperplane to separate the datasets of the
two classes. What are some other simple geometric entities other than a simple plane/line that
can be used to separate some of the data points that were not linearly separable?

Question 5. For example shown in the figure, what is approximately the output of the neuron?
